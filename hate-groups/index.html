        <h1>ECHOES OF EXTREMISM: AN EXPLORATION OF TRENDS IN HATE AND ANTI-GOVERNMENT GROUPS ACROSS AMERICA</h1>
        <p id = "name"> by Maximilien Boucher</p>
        <div class ="divider"></div>
        <p> Founded in 1971 in Montgomery, Alabama, the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> started as a civil rights law firm 
            and has since become a prominent organization dedicated to combating racism and extremism in the United States. 
            Every year, it tracks the presence and activities of hate and anti-government groups across the nation, 
            striving to limit their influence by exposing their actions and leaders. In an effort to better understand 
            how these movements have fluctuated over time and where they are today, I conducted an investigation using 
            the SPLC’s tracking data and by consulting with an analyst from their team. 
            </p>
            <img src = "hategroups.png">
        <p>As defined by the SPLC, hate groups hold beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire 
            class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics, while antigovernment groups 
            see the federal government as an enemy of the people and promote baseless conspiracy theories. 
            The provided graph indicates a notable decline in the number of hate groups over recent years, 
            reaching the lowest level since 2000. Concurrently, there has been a resurgence in antigovernment
            groups since 2021, following an eight-year period of decline. This juxtaposition suggests a 
            potential relationship between the trends of these two types of groups.</p>


        <p>At this juncture, our analysis raises two critical questions:</p>

        <p><strong>(1) Does the decrease in the number of hate groups correspond to a reduction in the overall level of hate in America?</strong>
            Investigating the prevalence of hate crimes could shed light on whether hate persists in society despite the diminished presence of groups that explicitly promote discriminatory ideologies.</p>

        <p><strong>(2) Could the dynamics of antigovernment groups offer insights into the trends observed with hate groups?</strong> 
            <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/4193/american-anti-government-groups/">Preliminary data</a> suggest that antigovernment activity tends to diminish when Republicans are in office (e.g., during the Bush and Trump administrations) and peaked during the presidency of Barack Obama, the first African American president. This pattern warrants further exploration to understand the interplay between political climates and the activities of these groups.
            </p>
            <img src = "hatecrime.png">
        <p> The paradoxical trend depicted in the chart is striking: hate crimes in the United States have surged to unprecedented levels, 
            while the number of hate groups has concurrently dwindled to historic lows. Occurring nearly every hour in 2022, according to 
            the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/ucr/hate-crime">FBI</a>, these crimes are defined by being “motivated by prejudice based on race, gender, gender identity, religion, disability, 
            sexual orientations, or ethnicity." The rise in hate crimes amid a fall in the number of identified hate groups raises urgent questions about the mechanisms of hate 
            transmission in society.  </p>
        <div class ="divider"></div>
        <h2>What is Actually Going on with Hate in America?</h2>
        <p>After consulting with a Southern Poverty Law Center representative and reviewing their annual documents, 
            including the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/year-hate-extremism-2022">2022 hate and extremism report</a>, it seems that the SPLC posits that hate has not actually diminished; 
            rather, it has <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/year-hate-extremism-2022/introduction#hateextremism">become more mainstream</a> and thus become less trackable. </p>
        <p>The central mechanism behind this dissemination is the migration of hate online. Hate speech and 
            extremist ideologies are proliferating on social media platforms such as Facebook and TikTok, reducing 
            the threshold for engagement. Individuals can now contribute to and feel a sense of belonging to a cause 
            with much more ease, expanding the solidarity once provided by formal group memberships
            (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/01/962973774/the-number-of-hate-groups-declined-last-year-but-hate-did-not">NPR</a>). </p>
        <p>This phenomenon of hate groups and ideas gaining traction online can be seen with the decline 
            of the "old school" and more traditional hate groups, such as the 
            Ku Klux Klan and Racist Skinheads, whose lack of online presences have been
            significant weaknesses in keeping their movements afloat.</p>

            <img src = "klan.png">

        <p>Moreover, the presence of extremist ideologies on social media platforms grants 
            them an unprecedented level of exposure. This dynamic was exacerbated in the 
            tumultuous landscape of 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic compelled a shift in social 
            dynamics, leading to a significant increase in online activity as individuals and 
            communities sought connection and information in a time of widespread lockdowns and 
            social distancing measures. Further, stringent Covid-19 restrictions, the salience of 
            the Black Lives Matter movement, and the contentious "Stop the Steal" campaign surrounding 
            the U.S. elections served as catalysts, igniting hate and antigovernment sentiment 
            and corresponding to vigorous online discourse.</p>
        
        <p>As more popular social media companies were forced to implement measures to address 
            the proliferation of hate on their platforms, other alternatives such as Signal, Parler,
             and Telegram that offered significantly less content moderation quickly grew in 
             popularity. </p>
        <img src = "telegram.png">
        <p>Telegram, in particular, has become a 
            <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/isd-publications/a-safe-space-to-hate-white-supremacist-mobilisation-on-telegram/">haven for hate groups</a> 
            and individuals who have been banned from other platforms. The platform’s end-to-end encryption and lack of content 
            moderation have made it a popular choice for those seeking to spread extremist ideologies 
            and organize events without fear of censorship. In fact, the peak of Telegram downloads 
            around the time of the January 6th Insurrection as highlighted in the visual above 
            mirrors the close to <a href = "https://www.statista.com/statistics/1365165/facebook-hate-orgs-removal-quarter/">10 million hate content items removed from Facebook</a> during the same period. </p>
        <div class ="divider"></div>
        <h2>How are Trends in the Antigovernment Movement Related Those in Hate?</h2>
        <img src = "politics.png">
        <p>The proliferation of these ideas on the internet has dramatically lowered the 
            barrier for participation in these movements, significantly broadening their reach. 
            In effect, this accessibility has also made it easier for political candidates to adopt 
            and leverage these conspiracies for popular support. The chart above highlights this by 
            showing how deeply government-related conspiracies and extremist ideologies have penetrated 
            the political landscape.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the endorsement of QAnon-like conspiracies by prominent figures such as former President 
            Trump has placed antigovernment groups in a weird position. While traditionally positioned against 
            the government, these groups found themselves in a paradox where the government appears to support 
            causes they align with. This unusual scenario contributes to a broader acceptance and normalization 
            of such extremist ideologies within higher political offices, allowing these movements to not only 
            prevail but continue to spread through society. </p>
        <div class ="divider"></div>
        <h2 class="how-built">How I Built It</h2>
            <p>The hate group tracking numbers are from the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">SPLC Hate Map</a>. 
            The dataset contains the number of hate groups based on ideology for every year since 2000. 
            As for the number of antigovernment groups, I used a mixed methodology to get the data as it was not 
            as openly available as the hate group data. This was done through going through combining numbers 
            I found in older reports (<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/year-hate-and-extremism-2019">2019</a>) 
            and through my interview with the SPLC representative. The data on the political endorsement of 
            extremist groups was sourced through the <a href="https://www.splcactionfund.org/projects/exposing-extremism-elections/data">SPLC Action Fund</a>. For the hate crime data, I used the FBI’s <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/publications#Hate-Crime-Statistics">Hate Crime Statistics</a>.
            I processed the data and created visuals using Python and polished them using Adobe Illustrator.</p>
